 Trigger Scenario: 17/20

"If the user attempts to change the Status__c field on the Account from 'Active' to 'Not Active,' 
the system should validate whether there are any Open Opportunities (Opportunities that are not Closed Won 
or Closed Lost) associated with the Account. If such Opportunities exist, the system should prevent the change
 and display an appropriate error message to the user."*/
